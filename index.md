These visualizations use data from the [Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP)](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html).

[Node link graph](https://bl.ocks.org/cpang4/5b2c36b4ff8e9b6d63163c72125b64c8)   
This graph implements a force-directed layout using the Fruchterman and Reingold algorithm. The file 698.edges is used.

[Matrix representation](https://bl.ocks.org/cpang4/d561b6985e8f415fea743f843451884b)   
This graph implements a matrix representation for the 698.edges file.

Note that if a larger .edges file is used, the visualizations (and interactivity) may be slightly slower.
